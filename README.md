# Global-EV-charging-Analysis 2024

# 🔌 EV Charging Behavior Analysis | Power BI Dashboard

This project explores the impact of **temperature on EV (Electric Vehicle) charging session outcomes** using a real-world dataset. The goal was to derive and visualize insights from a raw `.csv` file without any predefined questions — simulating a real business scenario.

---

## 📊 Objective

To analyze how environmental conditions — especially **temperature** — influence EV charging performance and outcomes, such as:
- ✅ Completed sessions
- ⚠️ Aborted sessions
- ❌ Failed sessions

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Charging failures increased at **extreme low and high temperatures**
- Moderate temperature bands (15°C–30°C) showed the highest completion rate
- Visual segmentation using **temperature bins** highlighted performance trends clearly

---

## 🔧 Tools & Techniques

- **Power BI Desktop**
  - Custom **temperature binning** (Power BI's built-in grouping)
  - **Clustered Column**, **100% Stacked Chart**, and **Line+Column Combo** visuals
  - Conditional formatting and clean KPI storytelling
- **Data Cleaning** in Power Query
- **DAX** for calculated columns and measures
